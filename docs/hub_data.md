# Hub Data Dictionary

What the Hub stores about runs, and how to query it. Written for people and AI assistants that answer questions such as "what failed last night, and where?". Start with the views; the tables behind them are listed after.

A test (`kinenix-hub/tests/test_data_dictionary.py`) fails when a table, view, column, or `details` key exists without a row here, or the other way round.

## How the data gets here

A worker sends one execution log per run when the flow ends ([logging.md](logging.md)). The Hub keeps the log whole in `executions.raw_log` and stores its facts as rows: one in `executions`, one in `step_results` per executed step (also every loop iteration, subflow steps, and On Error and Finally steps), and one in `failures` per failure (also failures the flow continued after).

- The worker removes secrets and personal data before sending ([logging.md, Redaction](logging.md#redaction)).
- Step outputs and step errors are stored at most 500 characters long, ending with `...` when cut; the full log stays in `executions.raw_log`.
- Runs from workers older than 0.2.0b4 have fewer facts: no run id, Kinenix version, work items, line, path, subflow, loop item, or retries. Their step outputs are not stored, because those workers did not redact them. Only the failure that stopped such a run has `handled = stopped`; other failed steps have an empty `handled`.
- When the Hub is upgraded, runs it already stored get their rows from `raw_log` once, at the first start.

## Conventions

- Times are UTC, stored as text `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ffffff`, so they sort and compare as text: `failed_at >= datetime('now', '-1 day')`.
- `section` is where a step is in `flow.md`: `steps`, `on_error` (`## On Error`), or `finally` (`## Finally`).
- `handled` is what happened after a step failed: `stopped` (the run stopped; On Error ran), `continued` (`on_error: continue`, or a step in On Error or Finally), `fallback` (`fallback_step_id` ran).
- `details` columns are JSON with a version key `v`; the views expose their keys as columns. The views exist on SQLite only.

| `applied_at` | When, UTC, ISO 8601 | `2026-10-14T06:50:28+00:00` |

## Run report

Each run gets a short Markdown report in `executions.details.report_md` (`v_runs.report_md`), for people, e-mail, and AI. Times are the worker's local time.

```markdown
# TIPH Quotes, 2026-10-12 02:00 +07:00 (failed)
- Worker: rpi4, Kinenix 0.2.0b4, duration 14 min
- Items: 6 of 12 done, 1 failed, 5 not reached
- Failed: R007 HONDA HR-V at "Choose Brand" (subflow process_one, line 42, after 2 retries), continued: Timeout 30000ms exceeded
- Failed: "Save Quotes" (line 60), run stopped: File is open in Excel
- On Error: Capture Screen succeeded, Email Error succeeded
- Finally: Close Browser succeeded
```

At most 10 failures are listed; the rest are counted. A run without failures says `- No failures`.

## Example questions

```sql
-- What failed since yesterday, and where?
SELECT failed_at, flow_name, worker_id, step_path, loop_item, handled, message
FROM v_failures WHERE failed_at >= datetime('now', '-1 day') ORDER BY failed_at;

-- Success rate and average duration per flow over the last 7 days
SELECT flow_name, COUNT(*) AS runs, AVG(status = 'success') AS success_rate, AVG(duration_seconds) AS avg_seconds
FROM v_runs WHERE started_at >= datetime('now', '-7 days') GROUP BY flow_name;

-- Steps that fail most
SELECT flow_name, step_name, action, COUNT(*) AS failures
FROM v_failures GROUP BY flow_name, step_name, action ORDER BY failures DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Slowest steps on average
SELECT flow_name, step_name, AVG(duration_seconds) AS avg_seconds, COUNT(*) AS runs
FROM v_steps WHERE status = 'success' GROUP BY flow_name, step_name ORDER BY avg_seconds DESC LIMIT 10;
```
