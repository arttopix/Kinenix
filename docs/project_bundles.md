# Modular Project Architecture & Unattended Lifecycle

This guide documents Kinenix's **Self-Contained Project Bundle** architecture, subflow execution standards, and the complete lifecycle from development to unattended deployment.

Your bundles live in your flows folder (default `~/kinenix-flows`), outside the Kinenix repository; `kinenix init` creates them there. The layout below is the inside of one bundle, wherever it lives. See [Where your flows live](quickstart.md#2-where-your-flows-live).

## 1. Self-Contained Project Bundle Overview

Enterprise automation workflows often contain multiple sub-processes, data files, and external templates. To avoid path dependencies, broken references, or variable collisions, Kinenix organizes workflows into **Self-Contained Project Bundles**:

```text
flows/
├── @shared/                                # Cross-project reusable library
│   ├── web_login_sso.json                  # SSO login component
│   └── send_email.md                       # Reusable Gmail/SMTP component
│
└── accounting/                             # Department / Business Domain
    └── invoice_tax_filing/                 # 1 Self-Contained Project Bundle
        ├── flow.md                         # Main flow, the file you edit (source of truth)
        ├── config.json                     # Project-specific configuration (Auto-loaded)
        ├── .env                            # Optional local secrets (Git-ignored)
        ├── subflows/                       # Project-specific subflows
        │   ├── download_tax_pdf.json
        │   └── extract_table.json
        └── assets/                         # Local templates, configs, test data
            └── tax_template.xlsx
```

### Key Principles:
- **Portability:** All references to assets and subflows inside a project bundle use **Relative Paths** (e.g. `./assets/tax_template.xlsx`, `./subflows/extract_table.md`).
- **No Hardcoded Absolute Paths:** Workflows never depend on developer-specific paths (e.g., `C:\Users\Dev\...`), ensuring seamless portability across different machines, VMs, or operating systems.
- **Atomic Units:** A single project directory represents one coherent unit of business automation that can be developed, tested, versioned, and deployed as a standalone bundle.
- **Decoupled Settings (`config.json`):** Engine automatically auto-loads `config.json` from the flow bundle directory into `${config.*}` and top-level variables. Business users or admins can modify endpoints, email recipients, or thresholds without altering `flow.json`.
- **Local Secrets (`.env`):** Optional project-level `.env` is automatically parsed and mapped to `${env.*}` for local execution without leaking credentials to version control.

## 2. Calling Subflows (`flow.call`)

The `flow.call` action runs another flow (a subflow) and can use the value it returns. Write subflows in the same Markdown format as `flow.md`; `flow.call` compiles a `.md` subflow when it runs, so no `.json` file is kept next to it. Existing `.json` subflows still work, and a target without an extension (`./subflows/extract_table`) uses the `.md` file when both exist.

### 2.1 Subflow of the Bundle (`./subflows/`)

```markdown
### 3. Extract Table Data (`flow.call`)
- **flow:** ./subflows/extract_table.md
- **inputs:** {"pdf_path": "${downloaded_pdf}"}
- **output_var:** `extracted_data`
```

A subflow inside the bundle works like part of the main flow:

- **Config:** it sees the bundle's `${config.*}`. An `inputs` key named `config` is merged over it, key by key.
- **Folder:** relative paths (`./output/...`, `./assets/...`) resolve against the bundle folder, not `subflows/`. A subflow can still call another subflow by a path relative to its own file (`./other.md` from `subflows/`).
- **Data:** other values reach the subflow only through `inputs`. The subflow declares them in its `## Variables`, with defaults; `kinenix validate` reports an `inputs` key the subflow does not declare.

The `hello` example (`kinenix init demo --example hello`) calls `subflows/make_greeting.md` once per name.

### 2.2 Shared Component (`@shared/`)

```markdown
### 1. Send LINE Alert (`flow.call`)
- **flow:** @shared/notify_line.md
- **inputs:** {"message": "Invoice tax filing completed successfully.", "token_env": "LINE_TOKEN"}
```

Components in `@shared/` (or any flow file outside the calling bundle) are used by many projects, so they keep their own folder and their own `config/config.json`. Give them values with `inputs`: the component's `## Variables` is its contract, and `kinenix validate` checks the names.

When a shared component needs many values from the caller's config, `inherit_config: true` passes the caller's whole config. The caller's keys win; keys only the component defines keep the component's defaults:

```markdown
> Requires: kinenix>=0.2.0b4

### 2. Monthly Report (`flow.call`)
- **flow:** @shared/monthly_report.md
- **inherit_config:** true
```

`inherit_config` needs Kinenix 0.2.0b4 or later; the `> Requires:` line under the flow's title makes older workers refuse the flow instead of running the subflow without the config.

This ties the component to the caller's key names, so prefer `inputs` for components used by projects with different configs.

### 2.3 Variable Scope Isolation
- When `flow.call` executes a subflow, the child flow receives its own isolated `ExecutionContext`.
- Only `inputs`, the config described above, and runtime sessions (for example the active Playwright browser) are shared with the child flow.
- Variables set inside the subflow do not overwrite the caller's variables. Values come back through `flow.return` and `output_var`, or `outputs`.

### 2.4 Validation
`kinenix validate`, `kinenix run`, and the worker check every subflow whose path is fixed (not built from `${...}`): that the file exists, its own problems (unknown actions and parameters, ignored lines), and the `inputs` names. Each subflow is checked once, also when subflows call each other.

## 3. Flow Lifecycle & Unattended Deployment Strategy

The project bundle structure directly enables a robust deployment pipeline to unattended robot workers (`kinenix-worker`):

> **Status:** Stage 1 and the sandbox workspace in Stage 4 (`kinenix-worker run --sandbox`) are implemented. Packaging, Hub distribution, the worker cache, and WebSocket streaming (Stages 2, 3, 5) are planned. See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

```text
[ Developer Machine ] -> [ Kinenix Hub ] -> [ Unattended Worker Daemon ]
  Local Dev & Test          Package & Version          Isolated Sandbox Execution
```

### Stage 1: Local Development & Verification
- Developer authors and tests the workflow locally within `flows/<dept>/<project>/`.
- Run and debug via CLI: `kinenix run <project_name>`.
- All assets remain inside `./assets/` and logs are written to central `logs/`.

### Stage 2: Packaging & Versioning
- The project bundle directory is packaged into a versioned archive (e.g. `invoice_tax_filing-1.0.0.kinpkg` or `.zip`).
- Any referenced `@shared/` flows are inlined by the packaging tool into the bundle, ensuring the archive is 100% self-contained.
- The package is published to **Kinenix Hub**.

### Stage 3: Distribution & Local Worker Cache
- Background daemons (`kinenix-worker`) running on target worker machines (Windows VMs, PCs, or Raspberry Pi) connect to Hub via WebSocket.
- When a job is dispatched, the worker checks its local package cache (`~/.kinenix/packages/` or `C:\ProgramData\Kinenix\packages\`).
- If the requested version is not present or updated, the worker downloads and verifies the package archive.

### Stage 4: Sandbox Workspace Isolation
- Prior to execution, the worker unpacks the project bundle into an isolated, per-job workspace directory:
  ```text
  ~/.kinenix/workspaces/job_20260911_001/
  ├── flow.md
  ├── subflows/
  └── assets/
  ```
- This ensures complete filesystem isolation, eliminates cross-job file locking or corruption, and allows clean workspace disposal after job completion.

### Stage 5: Execution & Telemetry
- Worker executes the bundle: `kinenix-worker run <bundle>`.
- Step results, business metrics, and failure screenshots are streamed in real time to the Hub dashboard.
