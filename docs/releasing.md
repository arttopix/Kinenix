# Releasing to PyPI

`kinenix`, `kinenix-hub`, and `kinenix-worker` are released together with one version number. Users install them with:

```bash
pip install kinenix              # core engine and the kinenix CLI
pip install "kinenix[worker]"    # adds kinenix-worker
pip install "kinenix[hub]"       # adds kinenix-hub (the `kinenix hub` command)
```

`kinenix-studio` is not published yet.

Publishing runs in GitHub Actions ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml)) with **PyPI Trusted Publishing**: PyPI trusts this repository's workflow directly, so no API token is stored anywhere.

## 1. One-time setup

### 1.1 Trusted publishers on PyPI

Sign in to https://pypi.org with the account that owns `kinenix`.

| Project | Where | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `kinenix` (exists) | Your projects, then `kinenix`, then **Manage**, then **Publishing** | Add a GitHub publisher |
| `kinenix-hub` (new) | Account menu, then **Publishing** (https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/) | Add a **pending** publisher with project name `kinenix-hub` |
| `kinenix-worker` (new) | Same page | Add a **pending** publisher with project name `kinenix-worker` |

Use these values:

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Owner | `arttopix` |
| Repository name | `Kinenix` |
| Workflow name | `release.yml` |
| Environment name | `pypi` for `kinenix`, **`pypi-hub`** for `kinenix-hub`, **`pypi-worker`** for `kinenix-worker` |

A pending publisher turns into the project on the first successful upload.

Each package has its own environment, and the release workflow publishes each one in its own job: `kinenix` first, then `kinenix-hub` and `kinenix-worker`.

- A job gets one OIDC token from PyPI, scoped to the publisher that matches the job's environment. When one environment matches the publishers of several projects (for example the active publisher of `kinenix` and a pending one for `kinenix-hub`), the token is valid for only one of them and the other uploads fail with `403 Invalid API Token: OIDC scoped token is not valid for project`.
- PyPI also refuses two pending publishers with the same owner, repository, workflow, and environment ("A pending trusted publisher matching this configuration has already been registered for a different project name").

Once a project exists, a pending publisher can no longer be added for it; add the publisher in the project's own settings (**Manage**, then **Publishing**) instead.

### 1.2 Trusted publishers on TestPyPI

Repeat 1.1 on https://test.pypi.org (a separate site with its own account), with environment names **`testpypi`** for `kinenix`, **`testpypi-hub`** for `kinenix-hub`, and **`testpypi-worker`** for `kinenix-worker`. Use it to try every release before the real one.

### 1.3 GitHub environments (recommended)

The workflow creates the `pypi`, `pypi-hub`, `pypi-worker`, `testpypi`, `testpypi-hub`, and `testpypi-worker` environments on first use. To require approval before anything is published, open the repository **Settings**, then **Environments**, then **pypi**, **pypi-hub**, and **pypi-worker**, and add yourself under **Required reviewers**.

## 2. Making a release

Released version numbers can never be reused on PyPI or TestPyPI. If something is wrong after an upload, fix it and release the next version (for example `0.2.0b2`).

1. **Bump the version** in a pull request into `dev`. Change all of these to the same value; a test fails if they differ:
   - `__version__` in `kinenix-core/kinenix/__init__.py`, `kinenix-hub/kinenix_hub/__init__.py`, and `kinenix-worker/kinenix_worker/__init__.py`
   - `kinenix-hub>=` and `kinenix-worker>=` in the extras of `kinenix-core/pyproject.toml`
   - `kinenix>=` in the dependencies of `kinenix-hub/pyproject.toml` and `kinenix-worker/pyproject.toml`
2. **Merge `dev` into `main`** through the usual release pull request. CI builds the packages, checks their metadata, and installs them in a clean environment.
3. **Try it on TestPyPI:** in GitHub, open **Actions**, then **Release**, then **Run workflow** on `main`. When it finishes, check in a new virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ "kinenix[hub,worker]==0.2.0b1"
   kinenix --version
   kinenix-worker --version
   ```
4. **Publish to PyPI** by tagging `main`:
   ```bash
   git switch main && git pull
   git tag v0.2.0b1
   git push origin v0.2.0b1
   ```
   The workflow builds again, checks that the tag matches the package version, and publishes all three packages.
5. Check https://pypi.org/project/kinenix/, `kinenix-hub`, and `kinenix-worker`, then install from PyPI in a clean environment.

## 3. Upgrading an installation

```bash
pip install --upgrade "kinenix[hub]"      # or "kinenix[worker]"
```

On Windows, stop any running `kinenix hub` or `kinenix-worker` from that environment first. Windows locks the running `kinenix.exe`, so pip can remove the old version but fail to install the new one, leaving `kinenix` uninstalled. If that happens, stop the process and run the same command again. A folder named like `~inenix-...dist-info` left in `site-packages` by the failed attempt can be deleted.

On a Raspberry Pi running the systemd service: `sudo systemctl stop kinenix-worker`, upgrade, then `sudo systemctl start kinenix-worker`.

## 4. What the checks cover

| Check | Where |
| :--- | :--- |
| All packages build as wheel and sdist | CI `packages` job, release workflow |
| PyPI metadata and README render (`twine check --strict`) | CI `packages` job, release workflow |
| One shared version; tag equals `v` + version | `.github/scripts/check_release.py` |
| Siblings require the same version | `kinenix-core/tests/test_repository_rules.py` |
| `kinenix[hub,worker]` installs from the built files in a clean environment, and `kinenix`, `kinenix hub`, `kinenix-worker`, and the dashboard files work | CI `packages` job |
