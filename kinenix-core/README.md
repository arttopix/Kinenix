# kinenix

Core execution engine and `kinenix` CLI for **Kinenix**, an open-source, local AI-native RPA framework in Python.

> **Status: beta.** Flow schemas and action parameters may still change between releases.

- Runs automation flows written as `flow.md`
- Built-in actions for web automation (Playwright), Excel and CSV (no Microsoft Office required), files, HTTP, email, and flow control
- Local AI actions through Ollama, so business data stays on your machine
- Retries, fallbacks, failure screenshots, and structured JSON execution logs

## Installation

```bash
pip install kinenix
kinenix install-browsers   # Playwright Chromium, needed for web actions
kinenix --version
```

Requires Python 3.10 or newer.

## Usage

```bash
kinenix list                       # list flows found in the current project
kinenix run path/to/bundle         # run the flow.md in a bundle folder
kinenix compile path/to/flow.md    # print the compiled form as JSON (inspection)
kinenix version                    # version and environment details
```
