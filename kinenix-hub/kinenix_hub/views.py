"""Views over the run records, so people and AI query one flat table instead of JSON (docs/hub_data.md).

Views hold no data, so the Hub drops and creates them at every start instead of changing them through
migrations. Kinenix view names start with `v_`; user views start with `custom_` and come from .sql files
in the user views folder (apply_user_views), so an upgrade never overwrites them.
The views read JSON with SQLite's json_extract; on another database they are not created.
